The latter domain will involve loading up to one million related BDM records, and may need a medium instance. So I would like our allocation to support choosing larger than a small instance, if needed by a particular domain.\r\n\r\nWe intend to develop capability to enable the Yggdrasil database and related content for a domain to be saved and loaded, with some capacity for domain federation i.e. allowing a user in one domain to search/query the existance of a person in a different domain (if allowed by the other domain owner).\r\n\r\nThe nature of these genealogical database domains are that they are relatively low in data volume but are semantically quite rich. Some supporting data, such as images of primary source material, will be larger, but static. Computational/cpu loads would be most intense when initially loading data in bulk or in user driven calculating of cohorts (group selections) and creating data extracts for further analysis. \r\n\r\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me on 03-97587017 if any further information is required.

You could manage a bunch of instances and the credentials for the\r\ninstances. \r\n\r\nTo kick this along, could you please complete the allocation request form\r\naccessible from here http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/allocations.html\r\n\r\nI have cc:ed Steven Manos who reviews the allocation requests so that he\r\nknows one is coming.\r\n\r\n\r\nNigel Ward\r\nDeputy Director, NeCTAR (National eResearch Collaboration Tools and\r\nResources)\r\nnigel.ward@nectar.org.au\r\n0414 234 040\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn 30/04/12 12:09 PM, \"Peter Sefton\" <P.Sefton@uws.edu.au> wrote:\r\n\r\nHi Nigel,\r\n\r\nI'm not the Open Repositories Steering committee and will likely be there\r\nin Edinburgh in July helping run the developer challenge.

These will connect to the Twitter API to continuously ingest tweets matching certain criteria (keywords, hashtags, etc.). Two trial yTK installs are currently running on my standard allocation NeCTAR instances.\r\n\r\nThese instances will be used simply to ingest and store data, which will be downloaded at regular intervals (weekly / monthly) by the researchers. NeCTAR instances are ideal for this because they are stable and independent; we have found that instances based on our university servers are interrupted too often by general server and network maintenance activities.\r\n\r\nEach individual instance will only need to be small, as ingestion of data from the Twitter API requires limited computing power, but it will need to be operational 24/7 and the databases holding the ingested tweets may grow large. By my calculation, the total number of core hours for one year of operation would therefore be 24h x 365d x 10 instances x 1 core = 87600h - but I'm not sure whether I understand the concept of core hours correctly.\r\n\r\nI'm also unclear whether object storage is a static storage space only, or whether it can hold continuously updated MySQL or similar databases. Over time, we will need increasing storage space for the Twitter databases on each instance; if these databases can be hosted on a central object storage space, this would be the preferred solution. If object storage cannot hold live databases, it may be better to increase the storage space allocated to each instance (if this is possible without going to medium or large instances - we don't need additional vCPUs, just additional storage) - or if all else fails, we'll simply have to manually download and delete data from these instances to make sure they don't run out of space.\r\n\r\nI hope this makes sense, and I'm happy to provide further information. In essence, we can do most of this work with the standard personal instances we already have access to - so what we're asking for is mainly a lifting of the three-month time limit on instances, access to a few more instances, and increased storage space for our data - as well as the formal grouping of these instances under one Tenant ID, of course.",

Apologies if that request is still being processed.\r\n\r\n\r\nI lead a team of social media researchers at QUT who are focussing on large-scale, long-term research into the uses of Twitter.\r\n\r\nFor our longitudinal work, we intend to set up several instances of the open-source Twitter tracking solution yourTwapperkeeper (https://github.com/jobrieniii/yourTwapperKeeper). These will connect to the Twitter API to continuously ingest tweets matching certain criteria (keywords, hashtags, etc.). Two trial yTK installs are currently running on my standard allocation NeCTAR instances.\r\n\r\nThese instances will be used simply to ingest and store data, which will be downloaded at regular intervals (weekly / monthly) by the researchers. NeCTAR instances are ideal for this because they are stable and independent; we have found that instances based on our university servers are interrupted too often by general server and network maintenance activities.\r\n\r\nEach individual instance will only need to be small, as ingestion of data from the Twitter API requires limited computing power, but it will need to be operational 24/7 and the databases holding the ingested tweets may grow large. By my calculation, the total number of core hours for one year of operation would therefore be 24h x 365d x 10 instances x 1 core = 87600h - but I'm not sure whether I understand the concept of core hours correctly.\r\n\r\nI'm also unclear whether object storage is a static storage space only, or whether it can hold continuously updated MySQL or similar databases. Over time, we will need increasing storage space for the Twitter databases on each instance; if these databases can be hosted on a central object storage space, this would be the preferred solution. If object storage cannot hold live databases, it may be better to increase the storage space allocated to each instance (if this is possible without going to medium or large instances - we don't need additional vCPUs, just additional storage) - or if all else fails, we'll simply have to manually download and delete data from these instances to make sure they don't run out of space.\r\n\r\nI hope this makes sense, and I'm happy to provide further information. In essence, we can do most of this work with the standard personal instances we already have access to - so what we're asking for is mainly a lifting of the three-month time limit on instances, access to a few more instances, and increased storage space for our data - as well as the formal grouping of these instances under one Tenant ID, of course.\r\n",

The reason for having multiple instances of each type of VM is to facilitate independent management of each by the appropriate dataset custodian or aggregator community.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the HuNI project the allocation will need to be increased further, as the number of integrated datasets grows. It might eventually reach 20 or 30, perhaps? At this stage I'm just asking for several VMs to begin with.\r\n\r\nI have only the vaguest idea of the number of core hours required.

We are interested in using the cloud for\r\nsome of the processing at periods of high load. We'd like to be able\r\nto keep the environment as similar as possible to the local\r\nworkstation arrangement to avoid the need to change scripts too much.\r\nOur systems are based on ubuntu precise, which you already have an\r\nimage of. We can easily clone our non-package software across (just a\r\ncopy of /usr/local/). What I need advice with is how to set up\r\nsomething resembling the networking between the individual machines -\r\nshared file systems and names/addresses to allow job submission. It\r\noccurs to me that another option may be to simply set up a single,\r\nvery large, virtual machine (say 50 cores) and have SGE manage\r\nsubmission to that machine alone. This eliminates the networking side\r\nof things, but I have no idea how well it will work with your physical\r\nhardware.\r\n\r\nThe jobs we run are moderately memory intensive and the datasets\r\nmoderately large, although nowhere near the size or complexity of some\r\nof the simulation based work. Typical processing is embarrassingly\r\nparallel - same thing done to lots of different brains - hence the\r\nattractiveness of clusters. Typical datasets for a project may be a\r\nfew hundred gig. Typical processing has steps requiring 8GB RAM.\r\nNaturally all of these requirements vary considerably.\r\n\r\nThe things I don't know how to deal with:\r\n\r\n1) Shared file system\r\n2) sharing addresses between machines\r\n",

As advised by Ms Lennie Au, here we request a  short testing time on NECTAR to benchmark our needs against available resources. This will allow us to precisely identify the sort of calculations we can do using NECTAR in the most efficient manner. Once benchmarking is done, I plan to submit an appropriately large allocation request. \r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that we do not intend to use NECTAR resources for calculations that can be efficiently done elsewhere (for example, NCI). Rather, we our objective is to identify NECTAR resources that can complement other resources. This motivates this allocation request for benchmarking purposes. ",

The reason I'm also using MSGFPlus is to see how well it performs compared to Inspect, as Inspect will become depreciated in the not too distant future, replaced by MSGFPlus. This will become a good test case to further develop the proteogenomic pipeline by attempting to annotate such a large genome, improving its robustness across many other complicated genomes.",

        "use_case": "We have recently been funded by the ARC Centre of Excellence on Climate System Science to develop a web portal where users can interact with animations of the spreading of tracer through the ocean. We envision the web portal to develop into the to-go-to place for people interested in ocean circulation pathways. The portal will be used by both researchers and members of the general public who want to study the pathways of marine debris and contaminants, as well as learn about the role of the ocean in global climate. We hope that we can use the Research Cloud at NeCTAR to host this high profile portal. \r\n\r\nAfter the Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011, one of the most pressing issues of general public concern was where the nuclear waste would end up. Similar reactions followed the Deep Water Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010 and (on a more local scale) the beaching of the container ship Rena in New Zealand in October 2011. Our online web portal can provide the general public with answers to these questions.\r\n\r\nRecently, we have developed a novel way to study spreading of tracer on the surface of the global ocean. In this method, which relies on iterating a simple vector-matrix multiplication, data from observed buoys in the global ocean are used to calculate the spreading of tracer from any point in the ocean over time. A manuscript detailing this method and applying it to the global garbage patches has been published in the A* peer-reviewed journal Environmental Research Letters. A video abstract of the method is available from http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4UK9Yt6A-s. The manuscript has gotten extensive media attention, both nationally and internationally, and the video abstract has been watched over 8,000 times in two weeks.\r\n\r\nThe method to calculate the evolution of tracer in the ocean is computationally extremely efficient, which opens up the possibility to let the general public directly interact with it. Which is why the ARC Centre of Excellence on Climate System Science has funded its development and we are now seeking NeCTAR help for the hosting. Further questions on the research of the portal can be directed to Erik van Sebille (E.vanSebille@unsw.eud.au), questions on the technical side can be directed to David Fuchs (D.Fuchs@unsw.edu.au)",

We do not, however, need the memory that comes with each core.\r\n\r\nWe don't expect high traffic to the web portal under normal operation, but envision that there could be peaks due to high exposure related to events in the media (such as another Fukushima). At these times, and particularly when media embeds the tool on their web sites, we expect that it will be very popular and provide high exposure."

Both will contain taxonomic information, detailed descriptions of the physical specimens housed at UQ, along with photos of the specimens.\r\n\r\nThese reference collections will be used during archaeological research to help determine which types of plants and shells have been found at different locations. Many of the found specimens will be burnt or decayed, and so different descriptors are required than in more generic reference resources. The existing references are either not specific to the Australian region, don't provide the required level of detail, or are only available offline in books.\r\n\r\nThe data and photos are being provided and updated by staff in the Archaeology division at UQ, with the project led by Andrew Fairbairn <a.fairbairn@uq.edu.au>.\r\n\r\nA test version of the database is available at http://archaeobotanyref-uat.qc.to/.\r\n\r\nThe database has been developed by the eResearch group at UQ using the Django web framework and Postgresql database.

Where resources can be updated regularly\r\n    b. Where team members can share daily updates on some important issues\r\n3. Data tables can be made available to the public and can be extracted from the cloud, but with some built in protocols. \r\n4.

Ethics approval for the relevant projects has already been obtained through the host universities HRECs. \r\n\r\nUpon completion of these pilot projects, it will be made available worldwide for other users to employ in research studies. We are hoping to provide a stable server for about 5 years (say) while we evaluate the utility of the app, its appeal in the broader psychophysics community, and build a user base. Once it becomes a vital piece of infrastructure for vision research, or traffic/usage becomes heavy, we will transition to a \"user pays\" model for providing the server.",

        "use_case": "* project description, significance and expected outcomes\r\nWe are developing next-generation diagnostic assays that use molecular circuitry to enable field-identification of viruses. The devices are constructed via nucleic acid networks, designed as a logic circuits, to link viral genetic signatures to an output text display of diagnoses. Viruses are a moving target for diagnostics, not just because of their infection time-course, but through their microevolution that helps them evade host defences. We have developed bioinformatics software for maximum capture of evolving viruses, which is able to identify regions of similarity in highly related sequences that are divergent from non-related sequences. The specificity of the software is controlled by user-inputs, and can be used to determine consensus sequences at the level of both species and subtype/strain as required. \r\n\r\nSignificance: Diagnostic technologies for individual detection of potential disease biomarkers are well established. Significant developments in recent years have occurred in the fields of (i) multiplexing, and (ii) rapid/low-resource detection.\r\n(i) Multiplex developments include high- and low-density spatial arrangements such as microarrays, or the use of multiple tags such as mass-tagged PCR, electrospray ionisation, or luminex beads. Our molecular circuits use a novel adaptation of spatial arrays to provide text outputs for autonomous diagnosis of multiple viral signature sequences. \r\n(ii) The most striking low resource development in diagnostics has been the lateral flow dipstick, which operates similarly to an at-home pregnancy test. The sensitivity of the standard device is limited, however, the subsequently reported nucleic acid lateral flow device utilizes PCR-based sensitivity with rapid duplex detection. Combined with isothermal amplification, this set-up holds the most promise for rapid end-point detection in low resource settings. Variations include detection by fluorescence, which improves sensitivity at the expense of requiring portable read-out devices, extension to low-density micro-arrays, or portable lab-on-a-chip devices that combine sample preparation, amplification, and detection in a single user-friendly device. Our proposal moves beyond these singleplex or duplex field-amenable endpoint devices by providing a method to detect multiple viral disease markers and also quantifying their amount, yet still in a field-amenable assay format.\r\n\r\nOutcome: A robust molecular diagnostic technology able to detect and quanitify multiple viruses, undergoing reasonable levels of microevolution, in a single field-amenable device.\r\n\r\n* Impact and innovation of the research\r\nOur circuitry is purely driven by molecules: no electronics are incorporated, and no electronic power is required for operation. By replacing electronic circuitry with molecular circuitry, we reduce electrical requirements and contribute to reduction in carbon footprints. In addition, previous field-amenable diagnostic assays have focused on the detection of only a few agents in a single device. Our use of molecular automata allows the development of a single field-based device that can identify and analyse the significance of multiple biomarker presence. Finally, our innovative custom bioinformatics software enables rapid and automated development of devices that encompasses viral microevolution, enabling comprehensive viral detection.\r\n\r\n* National benefit of the research\r\nNational research priority: Safeguarding Australia \r\n(i) The ability to detect viral infections, and quantitatively assess viral loads, all onsite in a clinic, field, or airport, would have a significant impact on disease treatment and epidemiology, protecting Australia from invasive diseases and pests. Infectious but asymptomatic virus carriers, as well as those in the early stage of infection that do not yet show disease, could be screened and isolated. This has major ramifications in airports, cruise ships, animal export industries, and general border control, and could result in major economic gains. Additionally, while this research is entirely focused on viral infections, the generic principles of our integrated diagnostic platforms are entirely amenable to other infections, such as bacteria and parasites.\r\n(ii) A hand-held device that quickly analyses for biosecurity threats and does not require electricity to operate would be a transformational defence technology, allowing soldiers to assess and contain bioterrorism attacks before extensive disease spread.  \r\n\r\nTargeted research areas: This proposal directly addresses several targeted research areas, including the development of bioinformatics methodology for rapidly evolving viruses and the use of nucleic acid computing networks to provide an alternative green technology that replace electronics and wires with molecules. Our nucleic acid networks will perform autonomous pattern recognition and data mining for assessment of disease state and diagnosis of viral infections. Additionally, our proposal indirectly addresses indigenous health and wellbeing, in the sense that any point-of-care inexpensive rapid assay for the detection of viruses of national significance will provide an enabling technology for communities in low-resource settings to take ownership of their personal and community human and animal health. Rapid on-site diagnosis allows for faster decisions on treatment and isolation, which can reduce morbidity and disease spread.\r\n",

The data for these is seen as a strong candidate for RDSI merit allocation later on, and we'd like to transition this public data now from the Monash LaRDS store to a NeCTAR volume in preparation, and to demonstrate the mechanism for storing open data once RDSI storage is available.\r\n\r\nWe're requesting a new, separate volume of 1TB for this tenancy.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nIn addition to using LaRDS for raw data, the service desires volume storage from NeCTAR. 1TB of fast storage would be used to serve preview images in the web view. Fast image serving is crucial to a web site that\u2019s fast and responsive. This storage should live at Monash university for close proximity to the compute nodes, and the LaRDS store.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe Australian Synchrotron (AS) doesn\u2019t guarantee the storage and availability users\u2019 data 3 months after it has been collected. This is problematic when considering the longevity of initial data potentially associated with future scientific discovery when analytical techniques improve. A large quantity of users at the AS access their data via MyTardis (which the NeCTAR-Funded Bioscience Data Platform is built upon).\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMonash University has offered to take responsibility for the storage and access of all data on the AS\u2019s Macromolecular beamlines (MX1 / MX2) regardless of the institution of the user collecting the data. The Monash LaRDS multi-petabyte store will be used to host the raw data. Monash University are committed to operating and supporting the service (named the Synchrotron Monash Storage Service, store.synchrotron.org.au) in partnership with the AS until at least 31 Dec 2014. Initially, the service is expected to capture 10TB/month of data for sharing and serving.\r\n\r\nThis service needs to provide reliable data access to users of the 24h facility and their collaborators. Such a service requires compute nodes to form a redundant, scalable architecture. Compute nodes are used to verify integrity of stored data, compress and store for long-term tape archival and stream zip/tar archives to users. Such an allocation from NeCTAR will help to ensure almost 100% uptime and support for potentially thousands of simultaneous users at a time.",

When parameters for a molecule are requested that is not in the database as series of calculations are performed in order to generate the required parameters. These parameters are then tested and refined. The database is still in its development phase and is currently being expanded. Our aim is not only to host the site itself on the NECTAR system but to use the capacity of the Q-cloud to perform the initial generation of parameters of 12,000 commonly used molecules and validation of a proportion of these and exiting molecules in the database. Automated procedures for this have been developed. These involve dynamically creating and removing VMs as required and as resources are available. While expanding the database we fully scalable and have the capacity to use all available resources. We are working with QCIF and are well placed to ensure efficient utilization of resources in the testing and start-up phases of the Q-cloud with a high value project.          ",

Systems beyond a given threshold are directed to HPC systems. The validation jobs are in the order of 1-4 hours. Validation is, however, an iterative process with 20 to 50 jobs per molecule. A priority list of 700 molecules have been identified for initial validation. While the resources requested are considerable these will be primarily required in this expansion phase. The system is also designed to be robust and responsive expanding to fill any spare capacity. Equally jobs can be easily suspended if there are other demands on the system without affecting the database itself. The storage request is required during the validation phase.

        "use_case": "We are developing an automated image analysis and data visualization pipeline for phenomics research in lab and field applications. Our NECTAR requirements are for a server to host the image data and run the scripts and software (currently R, Matlab, Python, rsync and some cron jobs) that organize and process the images and server them up to web users.\r\n\r\nIn the lab, we use DSLR and IP cameras to capture time-series images of plant growth in growth chambers and glass houses. We typically capture 6-12 images per hour for 12-24 hours a day.  2-4 cameras per chamber, up to 10MP per image. We currently have 4 chambers coming online (eight DSLR cameras [5-10MB images] and eight megapixel IP cameras [~500kb images]). In the glasshouses we are using 4 IP cameras per room. We have 2 rooms online with an additional 10 or more to be coming online in the next year.\r\n\r\nLAB data sets\r\n\r\nTypical lab image processing pipeline is something like:\r\nCamera capture\r\nFTP image to server\r\nImage renamed and moved in timestamped storage structure\r\nImage is unwarped, color corrected \r\nBackground removed via thresholding\r\nImage cropped down to each of 150 pots in the image. \r\nRGB data extraction and processing\r\nVisualization of images and numeric results\r\n\r\nCurrently some of these steps are automated, mostly we are batch running scripts on a set of images for a given experiment. Over the next year we hope to have most of the processing steps automated.\r\n\r\nImage and related numeric data is visualized online using our existing and in development visualization tools. Examples below.\r\n\r\nOur main computing needs are a lot of storage and a bit of processing power to handle the bulk image processing. \r\nStorage: If all chambers were online and ran 24/7 we\u2019d be generating about 25TB of image data a year. This is probably an overestimate of the amount of data but I don\u2019t have good estimates of how much space the processed data takes up yet. We are doing a series of processing steps and we will need to store intermediate copies of all images as they move through the pipeline until we have the whole system optimized. We will need to do this inefficiently at first with a lot of copies until we get the whole pipeline streamlined and we know what we can delete. \r\n\r\nProcessing: In the short run we will need more processing power when we bulk process things as currently we will run a script that will process all image captured over the last week or weeks. In the longer run, the processing should be automated and result in a more evenly distributed workload as images will be processed as they are captured. But if it is feasible we would like to offer users the option to reprocess image-sets on the fly (say to adjust thresholding values,etc) so this would result in larger jobs being lodged on a regular basis. This last part could potentially be treated as a separate (and future ) use case though.\r\n\r\nFIELD datasets\r\nTypical field camera:\r\nImage capture and ftp\r\nImage preprocessing\r\nImage postprocessing (Region of interest pixel analysis, etc)\r\n\r\nWe will capture images from a range of IP and DSLR cameras around the country at TERN and other field sites to record time-series phenology data. The image processing will use the same tools and online visualization interface as the lab data. This is part of a project with TERN to create a National Network of field \u201cphenocams\u201d to record environmental change. This could be treated as a separate project with NECTAR but the capture and analysis tools and pipeline run the same scripts and code so it would be easier to just build the system once for both projects. Data requirements will be much lower than for the lab data (Say <5 TB / year).\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent visualization tools:\r\nhttp://bit.ly/BVZLiveCams\r\n\r\nLong-term plan for our phenomics piepline:\r\nhttp://bit.ly/VyRFEr",

Marxan is the most widely used decision support software for conservation planning globally. It is used in over 100 countries to build marine and terrestrial conservation plans and national parks systems.  It dominates the world market for conservation land-use planning and new extensions are making it even more popular.  \r\nCurrently, the only supported deployment model of the software is through download and install by users. We have initiated an internal project to migrate the software to the QCIF research cloud (Q-Cloud) to enhance the utility of the software for ourselves and our researcher collaborators. The cloud migration will improve the ability for us to inform conservation planning decisions in Australia and globally and increase its utility worldwide.\r\nAmong our global users, there is a large number of government, educational and research organisations in Queensland who use Marxan to support their core business, including DEHP, DNRM, DNPRSR, QPWS, UQ, QUT, JCU, CQU, Griffith uni, and Bond uni. There&#39;s also a large number of government, research, and educational users nationwide. These users will benefit through improved delivery of decision support, enhanced scalability of computation, improved software performance, and better ease of use.\r\nThe software will be made available to select researchers in Queensland and around the world. Their ability to conduct large scale Marxan analysis will be enhanced, which will boost research, publications, citations, and impact factor, and improve the ability to influence conservation decisions globally.\r\nThis is part of a broader initiative to globalise the impact of the University of Queensland\u2019s conservation science.  Marxan is likely to be one of the major \u201cimpact\u201d stories when the ARC roll out impact assessment as part of the way the federal government fund universities.\r\n\r\nI have several test servers currently in use, and am conducting research and development that require larger scale computational resources. The architecture I'm developing uses R-Studio server as the front end for highly optimised C code.\r\n\r\nwww.uq.edu.au/marxan",

This would limit the transmission of large quantities of information continuously over AARNET between Melbourne and Brisbane at run time by the production Marxan system.

We'll have a large number of users and a large number of datasets from very small to very large. We anticipate the production system will go online early in 2014, and the computation performed by the system will incrementally ramp up between now and then. We'd like to make an additional request for increased computation resources when the production system is online. With the current request, we'd like to use about half the cores for continuously operating VM's, and we'd like to use the other half of the cores for cloud bursting with the Nimrod API. We're working with Minh Huynh at UQ RCC to use Nimrod cloud bursting API. The cloud bursting VM's will be used in this way:\r\n- At run time in the production system, Nimrod will spawn a large number of small VM's,\r\n- Once the computational tasks are completed by the large number of small VM's, Nimrod will terminate the large number of small VM instances, and return the computational resources to the NeCTAR pool,\r\n- This pattern of spawning a large number of small VM's and terminating the VM's when computation is complete will occur periodically on demand.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the new calibration algorithms we're developing require more computational resources than we've used in the past for Marxan. This gives the software new and enhanced functionality at the expense of requiring more computational resources on demand for short periods of time."

Each GVL would be expected to use perhaps 200GB of storage each (100GB for reference data and 100GB for tools and user data). These per-student GVLs will initially be started in and used for tutorials, and then remain in the student's 'possession' for such time until they make their own allocation request to NeCTAR. This will allow for students to complete all tutorials, become familiar with the GVL, start their own analyses and understand the resource requirements for a working GVL. Users will be encouraged to store data and analyses in persistent volumes that can then be remounted for subsequent use.\r\nThe pool of 200 cores will allow us to conduct tutorials with 20 (med + x.large = 2+8 = 10 cores each) GVLs concurrently (as for a tutorial with 20 students). We are not completely sure how students will continue to use their GVL instances, so this will also be something of a pilot; clearly we cannot support all 20 GVLs (=200 cores) persistently, so we will need to manage this, perhaps by limiting the time that the student GVLs are 'alive' to a month, in which time students need to request their own allocation and restart their GVL instance using that; this will free up cores in the GenomicsVL-student pool for the next tutorial.\r\nIn this way we hope to expose many end-users to the GVL, and encourage a subset to deploy and manage their own, perhaps on behalf of several users in their research group, for instance.

These processes require several cores and at least 64 or more of RAM per node. We have one node at present and is meaningless for our group as far as the number of projects, the number of people and the timelines of these project. Thus we request cores and RAM equating to several nodes for the Henry group. The nodes requested will be used on a regular basis for the analysis.

One of the computationally demanding tasks we run is de novo genome assembly which has both high memory and high compute demands.  We regularly do this for bacterial genomes with our collaborators in microbiology using our own hardware, however that hardware is shared and regularly overloaded.   And the computation demands are significantly higher when we work on eukaryotes.\r\n\r\nSome of the other tasks we perform with our collaborators involve variant calling, and RNA-seq analysis.  Both of which require mapping a large number of next-generation sequencing (NGS) reads to a genome.  This is reasonably parallelizable across compute nodes using existing software.  So, would map nicely onto a number of cloud compute instances.\r\n\r\nApart from these specific tasks we'd like to use the cloud instances for, we also maintain a server that is well customized for the type of bioinformatics analysis we perform.  It would be useful to be able to have a snapshot of this setup on a cloud volume so that we could give other bioinformaticians around Monash the ability to easily create their own cloud instance based on our setup.

Potential configuration: one large instance for the Java servlet container and database; and four medium instances, each running Rserve, connected via TCP to main instance.\r\n\r\nStorage breakdown for current OzTrack deployment (oztrack.org): animal tracking data 1.0 GiB; external environmental layers, e.g. land use and bathymetry grids, 5.7 GiB; daily/weekly/monthly back-ups of animal tracking data 4.4 GiB. Animal tracking data is likely to remain small, but plans for pre-seeding tile caches of environmental layers in GeoServer mean that we are requesting 100 GiB of storage.\r\n\r\nAs for the object store, we are not sure at this stage whether it will be required. We are considering using it for backups and potentially for storing environmental data files. We have applied for an allocation in order to experiment with it and decide whether it is appropriate."

To achieve this we are currently in the process sequencing the genomes and/or exomes (i.e. the subset of the genome that contains protein coding genes) of approximately 300 children affected by these illnesses and, where possible, their unaffected family members. In total we will be sequencing the exomes of over 1000 individuals in the next 12 months. \r\n",

Once we have all the VM images/snapshots ready and pipelines and scripts set in place, I can then request from NECTAR admins for more resources or storage space in case this is needed, but this won't be needed initially. Some genomics work is known to be RAM-limited rather than CPU-limited, due to the huge datasets, and this is the reason (high RAM) I may need to do run an xx-large instance, but again this will not be needed until I have set up my development environment on snapshots and running test runs of the pipeline (and I become comfortable with the NECTAR openstack system).\r\n\r\nIn general, I estimate the workload per year will be fairly very low compared to researchers from other fields, since microbiome research constitutes only a percentage of all of our research."

This is especially true for species of industrial and/or ecological importance (instead of the classic lab models: mouse, human, fruitfly etc). The bottleneck is not the processing of the data (dealt via HPC) but the dissemination and visualization in a standardized, pain-free format. Further, curation and interactivity allows the web users to edit and curate the metadata in a crowdsourcing approach. Our work has produced such a system, written in PHP (Drupal), JavaScript (ExtJS and JQuery) and some perl code. We are now seeking to deploy it as domain-specific web-servers (e.g. only for specific species or projects). Each instance will host a webserver that will serve domain-specific data in a common GUI. Users will be using port 80 to access the interface. Administrators (one or two individuals) will be responsible for maintaining the web server but we don't expect frequent updates. Data will be derived from a database server located elsewhere on the NECTaR cloud and/or within CSIRO. An example can be seen at http://insectacentral.org. Previous work has been cited 38 times since 2008 (DOI: 10.1093/nar/gkm853). I'm more than happy to provide more information if this is required. ",

This laboratory is located in the School of Biological Sciences and Centre for Marine Science and is comprised on two research groups, the Sandie Degnan Lab and the Bernie Degnan Lab. There are 20+ researchers and postgraduate students in these labs, most of which have bioinformatics intensive projects. Most of the research is focussed on the analysis of the structure, function and organisation of the genome of the model marine sponge Amphimedon queenslandica and its bacterial symbionts.  This is one the premier models to understand the evolution and ecology of animals at the genomic level and the first, and still only, marine animal in Australia to have it genome sequenced and published.  Recent research outcomes from this genome project have been published in Science (IF 31.0), Nature (IF 38.6), Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (IF 9.7), PLoS Biol (IF 12.7), Current Biology (IF 9.5), Nature Microbiol Rev (IF 22.5), Nature Struct Mol Biol (IF 11.9) and Mol Biol Evol (IF 10.4). \r\n\r\nThe addition of other marine genomes and transcriptomes (e.g. the pearl oyster Pinctada maxima and the starfish \u201cCrown of Thorns\u201d Acanthaster planci) into this data collection enable collaborations with local universities and institutes and with Australian industry partners, in addition to a large diversity of international partners.  Each of these interactions provide unique platforms to expand the use of genomic information in marine science, particularly in tropical Australia. We require the capacity to undertake de novo genome, transcriptome and metagenome assembly, sequence annotation, database querying as well as host a private as well as publicly available genome browser that enables us, our collaborators and other researchers across the globe to interact with the genomic information we are generating. \r\n",

Metal clusters deposited onto surfaces, containing as few as several atoms, have been shown to induce catalysed activity at significantly lower temperatures compared with bulk metallic surfaces. The study and understanding of the underlying principles of these effects will provide a revolutionary methodology for developing next generation ultra-efficient and cheaper catalysts.\r\n\r\nOur research involves the theoretical study of the chemical and physical properties of metal clusters, their interactions with surfaces, and their chemical activity towards important molecules such as CO2 and H2O.

As the animations were neither long (in time) or large (in screen size), this was more less manageable. Recently there has been an increasing trend towards large scale landscapes and environments, as well as new formats for display (the new CAVE installation at Monash, for example, which requires images at resolutions of 27,000 pixels). We are currently quite compromised in what we can achieve using 3-4 Mac Book Pro laptops. \r\n\r\nThe preeminent projects where a rendering farm is required are the Visualising Angkor Project and the Monash Country Lines Archive.\r\n\r\n1. The Visualising Angkor project explores the 3D generation and animation of landscapes, people, soundscapes and architecture in a medieval century Cambodian metropolis. The resulting scenes draw upon a wide range of archaeological and historical data, from bas-reliefs to Chinese eye-witness accounts and extensive mapping undertaken by the Greater Angkor Project and the EFEO. In comparison to the familiar historical staples of Rome, Greece and Egypt, the virtual image of Angkor remains unexplored. The recent inclusion of Angkor as a subject of study in the Australian national High School history curriculum is timely, but it also presents some interesting challenges.\r\n\r\n2. The Monash Country Lines Archive (MCLA) is a collaborative Monash University project between the Monash Indigenous Centre (MIC), Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Information Technology with a team of Monash researchers, digital animators and post-graduate students from the Monash Indigenous Centre, Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Information Technology. The Monash Country Line Archive demands intellectual engagement in regards to issues associated with how best to construct a living archive that is a decolonised space in which communities are happy to see their material stored. It also provides an exciting place for scholars to work and share knowledge.\r\n",

For some reason, my original allocation request is not showing in the NeCTAR dashboard. This is why I've made a new request instead of requesting additional resources under the existing request, but this request is actually a request for an increase in allocation for the existing request as opposed to a new request.\r\n\r\nWe want to request additional computing resources to use for the Marxan project. We're working with QCIF and UQ Research Computing Centre to complete a cloud migration of the Marxan software.\r\nMarxan is the most widely used decision support software for conservation planning globally. It is used in over 100 countries to build marine and terrestrial conservation plans and national parks systems.  It dominates the world market for conservation land-use planning and new extensions are making it even more popular.  \r\nCurrently, the only supported deployment model of the software is through download and install by users. We have initiated an internal project to migrate the software to the QCIF research cloud (Q-Cloud) to enhance the utility of the software for ourselves and our researcher collaborators. The cloud migration will improve the ability for us to inform conservation planning decisions in Australia and globally and increase its utility worldwide.\r\nAmong our global users, there is a large number of government, educational and research organisations in Queensland who use Marxan to support their core business, including DEHP, DNRM, DNPRSR, QPWS, UQ, QUT, JCU, CQU, Griffith uni, and Bond uni. There's also a large number of government, research, and educational users nationwide. These users will benefit through improved delivery of decision support, enhanced scalability of computation, improved software performance, and better ease of use.\r\nThe software will be made available to select researchers in Queensland and around the world. Their ability to conduct large scale Marxan analysis will be enhanced, which will boost research, publications, citations, and impact factor, and improve the ability to influence conservation decisions globally.\r\nThis is part of a broader initiative to globalise the impact of the University of Queensland\u2019s conservation science.  Marxan is likely to be one of the major \u201cimpact\u201d stories when the ARC roll out impact assessment as part of the way the federal government fund universities.",

How I would like to use the extra computational resources I'm requesting now is in this way:\r\n- At run time in the production system, Nimrod will spawn a large number of small VM's,\r\n- Once the computational tasks are completed by the large number of small VM's, Nimrod will terminate the large number of small VM instances, and return the computational resources to the NeCTAR pool,\r\n- This pattern of spawning VM's and terminating the VM's when computation is complete will occur periodically on demand.\r\n\r\nThe existing 2 v v large VM's I requested on June 4th 2013 will host the production system, and these 2 VM's will run continuously. This additional request is to allow extra VM's to be spawned on demand for short periods of time. The Nimrod cloud bursting API will return the computational resources for the extra VM's to the NeCTAR pool at the completion of the Nimrod cloud bursting runs.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the new calibration algorithms we're developing require more computational resources than we've used in the past for Marxan. This gives the software new and enhanced functionality at the expense of requiring more computational resources on demand for short periods of time."

The significance of this project lies in its capacity to use a novel approach to develop a better understanding of the glycobiology of viral infection. The uniqueness of the proposed project lies in the application of molecular dynamics (MD) as a tool to understand the underlying microscopic processes of carbohydrate-protein interaction responsible for a viral infection, making the design of more specific drugs feasible. Previous success with the development of the anti-influenza drug Relenza\u00ae suggests that targeting proteins associated with carbohydrate recognition is a viable approach towards the development of new drugs.\r\nThe outcomes of these studies will and have been published in peer-reviewed journals (JACS 2012, 134 (44), 18447) and are presented at international conferences.\r\n",

Such data is routinely used at multiple stages in Drug Discovery, for the screening of ligands, estimation of ligand binding affinity and also to infer binding site information. \r\n\r\nI am building a machine learning algorithm to automate the assignment of NMR data.  I seek access to cluster facilities in order to obtain a performance advantage for the underlying relational database and large-scale linear algebra and statistical operations I require.  Multiple processors and access to large memory reserves could enhance rapid performance testing and code optimistation.  In addition, access to 30 GB of disk storage would be advantageous for storing of raw data and test data for the various stages of code optimisation.\r\n\r\nThe primary aim is for this work is to be the central theme of a publication in a peer-reviewed journal.  A secondary aim is to create a repository of manually assigned NMR data for further data mining / feature extraction, improved accuracy in the estimation of statistical parameters, and tuning the predictive algorithm for protein subclasses.  In addition, the work will have industry relevance for commercial drug discovery.  ",

We have one node at present and is meaningless for our group as far as the number of projects, the number of people and the timelines of these project.

I intend to use these resources for two aspects of my project.  1) to increase the number of parameter sets I am able to simulate simultaneously. I am currently limited to 8 simultaneous simulations on my work desktop.   and 2) to increase the size of simulated networks.  I am currently limited to ~250 neurons, while some complex network dynamics only emerge with greater than ~1000 neurons. \r\n\r\nThe brain is able to continually change its activity state in response to internal representations and external stimuli.  This body of work aims to elucidate how various neural architectures are able to self-regulate these changes in activity states. Specifically, we would like to study dynamical switching mechanisms in neural networks that exhibit complex self-sustained activity.  Some of the neural regions of interest have over a million neurons and we expect that simulations siees will continue to improve with the development of modelling techniques coupled to increases in computational power.",

These will connect to the Twitter API to continuously ingest tweets matching certain criteria (keywords, hashtags, etc.). Two trial yTK installs are currently running on my standard allocation NeCTAR instances.\r\n\r\nThese instances will be used simply to ingest and store data, which will be downloaded at regular intervals (weekly / monthly) by the researchers. NeCTAR instances are ideal for this because they are stable and independent; we have found that instances based on our university servers are interrupted too often by general server and network maintenance activities.\r\n\r\nEach individual instance will only need to be small, as ingestion of data from the Twitter API requires limited computing power, but it will need to be operational 24/7 and the databases holding the ingested tweets may grow large.

One of the computationally demanding tasks we run is de novo genome assembly which has both high memory and high compute demands.  We regularly do this for bacterial genomes with our collaborators in microbiology using our own hardware, however that hardware is shared and regularly overloaded.   And the computation demands are significantly higher when we work on eukaryotes.\r\n\r\nSome of the other tasks we perform with our collaborators involve variant calling, and RNA-seq analysis.  Both of which require mapping a large number of next-generation sequencing (NGS) reads to a genome.  This is reasonably parallelizable across compute nodes using existing software.  So, would map nicely onto a number of cloud compute instances.\r\n\r\nApart from these specific tasks we'd like to use the cloud instances for, we also maintain a server that is well customized for the type of bioinformatics analysis we perform.  It would be useful to be able to have a snapshot of this setup on a cloud volume so that we could give other bioinformaticians around Monash the ability to easily create their own cloud instance based on our setup.

Potential configuration: one large instance for the Java servlet container and database; and four medium instances, each running Rserve, connected via TCP to main instance.\r\n\r\nStorage breakdown for current OzTrack deployment (oztrack.org): animal tracking data 1.0 GiB; external environmental layers, e.g. land use and bathymetry grids, 5.7 GiB; daily/weekly/monthly back-ups of animal tracking data 4.4 GiB. Animal tracking data is likely to remain small, but plans for pre-seeding tile caches of environmental layers in GeoServer mean that we are requesting 100 GiB of storage.\r\n\r\nAs for the object store, we are not sure at this stage whether it will be required.

Included in our efforts are: 1) Antarctic Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) samples from up to 30000 years ago, which will be compared to modern Adelie genomes to investigate adaptation to climate change occurring since the last glacial maximum 2) Samples of extinct Moa (Dinornis spp.) from New Zealand, which are analyzed in efforts to understand the evolution of flightlessness, as well as trace the evolutionary relationships amongst extant and extinct ratites 3) Samples of the \u2018First Australians\u2019, representing the earliest known human remains in Australia (ca. 45,000 ya), the sequencing of which will help us to better understand the origins and characteristics of the first human inhabitants of Australia. Our lab is currently composed our Principal Investigator David Lambert, five post-doctoral scholars and two PhD students. A third PhD student is expected within the next year. It is expected that most of the members of our lab will use the allotted computing space, both for storage of next-generation sequencing data that is currently being generated, and for analyses of this data. In addition, it is likely that several international collaborators will utilize the space for shared data and analyses.\r\n",

This laboratory is located in the School of Biological Sciences and Centre for Marine Science and is comprised on two research groups, the Sandie Degnan Lab and the Bernie Degnan Lab. There are 20+ researchers and postgraduate students in these labs, most of which have bioinformatics intensive projects. Most of the research is focussed on the analysis of the structure, function and organisation of the genome of the model marine sponge Amphimedon queenslandica and its bacterial symbionts.  This is one the premier models to understand the evolution and ecology of animals at the genomic level and the first, and still only, marine animal in Australia to have it genome sequenced and published.  Recent research outcomes from this genome project have been published in Science (IF 31.0), Nature (IF 38.6), Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (IF 9.7), PLoS Biol (IF 12.7), Current Biology (IF 9.5), Nature Microbiol Rev (IF 22.5), Nature Struct Mol Biol (IF 11.9) and Mol Biol Evol (IF 10.4). \r\n\r\nThe addition of other marine genomes and transcriptomes (e.g. the pearl oyster Pinctada maxima and the starfish \u201cCrown of Thorns\u201d Acanthaster planci) into this data collection enable collaborations with local universities and institutes and with Australian industry partners, in addition to a large diversity of international partners.  Each of these interactions provide unique platforms to expand the use of genomic information in marine science, particularly in tropical Australia. We require the capacity to undertake de novo genome, transcriptome and metagenome assembly, sequence annotation, database querying as well as host a private as well as publicly available genome browser that enables us, our collaborators and other researchers across the globe to interact with the genomic information we are generating. \r\n",

        "use_case": "In this project, an algorithm has been developed to infer a persons road trajectory using POI information sent to a LBS such as Google Maps.\r\n\r\nWe have a number of use cases from the Microsoft Geolife dataset to test the algorithm on.\r\n\r\nThe system that runs the algorithm is distributed so the more machines that run the software, the faster the results will be produced and refinements can be made.\r\n\r\nA working instance and snapshot has been created which runs the system, all that is required now is the ability to load more instances.\r\n\r\nProject Summary\r\n\r\nMobile smart phones have become ubiquitous. The market success of these devices combined with advancements in mobile network infrastructure has created a strong market for third party apps and location based service (LBS) providers. While the apps and service providers are of great convenience to its users, there are concerns of the privacy implications associated.\r\n\r\nSmart phones capture a lot of information about a user. We hypothesis that data internal to these devices sent via a network can be combined with rich external data to recreate a very accurate profile about an individual. \r\n\r\nWhile it's often speculated that personal information can be inferred from sensitive data, literature to highlight tools and techniques utilized to invade user privacy is scarce.\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nMobile privacy has recently become a well-researched topic in pervasive computing.\r\n\r\nHowever, little work has been attempted on inferring personal information about a user such as communications meta-data, trajectories of individuals accessing location-based services, social media services used and if mobile sensors can be used to ID a person. We present a collection of algorithms and techniques that is able to infer information about an individual based on data stored on a mobile device. \r\n\r\nAn individual\u2019s trajectory to a high degree of precision was established given that they send continuous queries requesting the closest point of interest (e.g., restaurant) from a location service provider. The algorithm to infer the user\u2019s trajectory is based on the query result locations instead of the actual user locations.\r\n\r\nLegislation may not permit the location service provider to exchange user location data, but may permit the exchange of the query results with third parties. We reveal a user\u2019s trajectory via an indirect approach showing that user privacy is not preserved with the storage and exchange of query results. Experimental evaluation indicates in some cases that a user\u2019s trajectory can be determined to a high accuracy given a small set of points in real scenarios. \r\n\r\nThe current platforms dominating the mobile market including iOS and Android allow for easy collection of user information via the public APIs they provide. We demonstrate how data can be sent to a remote server without the user being aware and highlight mobile applications are requesting excessive use of permissions in the Google Play store relative to the advertised functionality they provide.\r\n\r\nKeywords: location, privacy, inference attack, trajectory, Voronoi diagram, points of interest, mobile smart phones\r\n\r\n",

The project addresses one of the five societal challenges suggested by the Chief Scientist Ian Chubb and endorsed by the Australian Government in June 2013 - \"living in a changing environment\". As a result, new sustainable and recyclable materials to be used as liquid electrolytes in renewable energies devices such as metal-ion batteries, solar and fuel cells need to be designed to allow us to have a fully sustainable future in Australia. The outcomes of our project will enable scientists to design novel electrolytes using quantum chemical methods, i.e. from first principles. In order to be cost-effective, these new electrolytes should be mixtures of existing organic solvents and ionic liquids. One of the goals of the project is to establish what combinations of ionic liquids and organic solvents will result in sustainable liquid electrolytes with enhanced transport properties and efficient performance in renewable energy devices. Hazardous solvents used to manufacture a vast number of polymers will need to be phased out in the future. Ionic liquids are considered the best environmentally friendly replacement  of organic solvents, thus making them the ideal medium for industrially important processes such as radical polymerisation. The project also aims to predict kinetic rates of radical polymerisation in ionic liquids with the view of designing task-specific ionic liquids for polymerisation reactions.

There is much available research in the area of performance analysis of VMs of \r\n\r\npopular Clouds services like Amazon. Unfortunately there is no data or publications on the failure \r\n\r\npatterns of Virtual Machines (VMs), its root causes, rates of failures, duration of failures and booting \r\n\r\ntime after failures. Such data will be extremely useful for our research to develop realistic scheduling \r\n\r\nalgorithms for scientific application. Algorithms developed with this knowledge can hugely improve \r\n\r\nthe performance of scientific application and make them highly suitable for Cloud environments. \r\n\r\nHence, accessing VM usage data and more specifically VM failure traces will be an essential enabler \r\n\r\nfor our work. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMore specifically we are interested in obtaining data about (i) VMs failure over period of time, (ii) \r\n\r\ncauses for such failures, (iii) duration of the VM failures and (iv) booting time of VMs after failure. \r\n\r\nWe would also like to believe, that the failure analysis we perform would benefit Nectar to have \r\n\r\ndetailed knowledge of VM failures, which might benefit you to develop better fault-tolerant \r\n\r\ninfrastructure. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFurthermore, most of this information is already present in the form of a relational database in each \r\n\r\ncluster of physical machine in the Nectar infrastructure. Exposing an interface to these databases (or \r\n\r\nreplicated database instances) would allow us to perform our analyses in a timely manner and \r\n\r\nwithout requiring too much assistance from the Nectar team.

The market success of these devices combined with advancements in mobile network infrastructure has created a strong market for third party apps and location based service (LBS) providers. While the apps and service providers are of great convenience to its users, there are concerns of the privacy implications associated.\r\n\r\nSmart phones capture a lot of information about a user. We hypothesis that data internal to these devices sent via a network can be combined with rich external data to recreate a very accurate profile about an individual. \r\n\r\nWhile it's often speculated that personal information can be inferred from sensitive data, literature to highlight tools and techniques utilized to invade user privacy is scarce.\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nMobile privacy has recently become a well-researched topic in pervasive computing.\r\n\r\nHowever, little work has been attempted on inferring personal information about a user such as communications meta-data, trajectories of individuals accessing location-based services, social media services used and if mobile sensors can be used to ID a person. We present a collection of algorithms and techniques that is able to infer information about an individual based on data stored on a mobile device. \r\n\r\nAn individual\u2019s trajectory to a high degree of precision was established given that they send continuous queries requesting the closest point of interest (e.g., restaurant) from a location service provider. The algorithm to infer the user\u2019s trajectory is based on the query result locations instead of the actual user locations.\r\n\r\nLegislation may not permit the location service provider to exchange user location data, but may permit the exchange of the query results with third parties. We reveal a user\u2019s trajectory via an indirect approach showing that user privacy is not preserved with the storage and exchange of query results. Experimental evaluation indicates in some cases that a user\u2019s trajectory can be determined to a high accuracy given a small set of points in real scenarios. \r\n\r\nThe current platforms dominating the mobile market including iOS and Android allow for easy collection of user information via the public APIs they provide. We demonstrate how data can be sent to a remote server without the user being aware and highlight mobile applications are requesting excessive use of permissions in the Google Play store relative to the advertised functionality they provide.\r\n\r\nKeywords: location, privacy, inference attack, trajectory, Voronoi diagram, points of interest, mobile smart phones\r\n\r\n",

The system is abstract enough reach several research communities, such as medicine, environment and climate, etc. but also PhD students who often need to have good ways of visualising the data they process. It has the potential to become a widely used if it becomes a fully implemented.\r\n\r\nFor now, we are reaching the point where the implementation of a demonstrator for this architecture is needed in order to showcase it. To demonstrate the fact that this architecture is able to scale to several cloud platforms and run smoothly, we require a three virtual machines to be running on NeCTAR. Two of them will be used for running (non intensive) computation models, and one will be used as a web server, enabling visualisation of the data through a web browser.\r\n\r\nThe other virtual machines needed for this demonstrator will be hosted on other cloud platforms.",

It is based on microsimulations of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in humans, originally developed for simulating malaria vaccines. These models simulate the dynamics of malaria parasitaemia in the course of an infection, of transmission, of immunity, and of the processes leading to illness and death. The system is set up to simulate malaria in villages, or district size human populations. The original models were extended to include simulation of the dynamics of malaria in the mosquito vector, and by including alternative model structures for many of the components of the human models. The models allow for variations among humans in their exposure to mosquitoes, and in their responses to the parasite.  OpenMalaria will used to simulate interventions against the mosquito vector and interventions that act against malaria in humans (for example, chemotherapy and vaccines).\r\n\r\nWe propose to exploit the functionality of this modelling platform to provide high quality input to policy and planning processes. This entails the modelling of intervention mixes, including vaccines, vector control, and chemotherapy, and also surveillance and response systems.\r\n\r\nWe propose to exploit the functionality of the malaria modelling platform to provide high quality input to policy and planning processes. \u00a0This entails the modelling of intervention mixes with a focus on various surveillance schemes. \u00a0We will use the OpenMalaria\u00a0computing platform to make predictions of the likely effects of different interventions across a range of deployment options using model ensembles, as described above. ??We propose to use our models to identify appropriate integrated (existing) intervention strategies for different ecotypes studying ?(i) effects of combinations of interventions/tools, ?(ii) effects of scheduling of interventions (one particular example being the timing and frequency of IRS rounds), \u00a0?(iii) the appropriateness of current guidelines used for approval of interventions (such as those of WHOPES), ?(iv) effects of sub-optimal prescription and drug delivery (including effects on resistance), ?(v) determinants of the spread of resistance and insensitivity to interventions. \u00a0?In addition, we will use our modelling platform to address specific stakeholder questions of public health impact and cost-effectiveness of intervention combinations, for example the W.H.O. and Malaria Vaccine initiative??This work will build on the standard descriptions of transmission and health systems being constructed in our current project phase, and will include simulating surveillance as an intervention, with the objective of being able to propose improved surveillance strategies and optimised resource allocation in settings where malaria transmission is sporadic. \u00a0We envisage that this work will consider overall effects on the health system, taking the capabilities of existing health systems into account.",

Since we have industry partners of IBM and TIBCO who offered us commercial grade of products, some of those are to be used by the project and likely hosted on cloud, so we would like to apply reasonable resources that are adequate to support a private cloud scenario (e.g. hosting IBM Smart Cloud Technology, a private cloud environment).

Since we have industry partners of IBM and TIBCO who offered us commercial grade of products, some of those are to be used by the project and likely hosted on cloud, so we would like to apply reasonable resources that are adequate to support a private cloud scenario (e.g. hosting IBM Smart Cloud Technology, a private cloud environment).

While\r\nthe configuration checking strategy handles this prob-\r\nlem considerably, it still solves them poorly, in terms of\r\nboth run times and numbers of flips. In this paper we\r\nhave developed a GSAT-based solver based on the no-\r\ntions of penult age and k-distance variable that prevent\r\ncycles in a novel locking and unlocking mechanism, to-\r\ngether with a hash heuristic as an auxiliary. On random\r\n3-SAT benchmarks our solver outstrips all others on\r\nmost instances, and surpasses other GSAT-based solvers\r\nby orders of magnitude on huge instances. Moreover, on\r\ncrafted benchmarks we have improved the solving ca-\r\npabilities of local search solvers, and solved much more\r\ninstances than others in some domains. So far our strate-\r\ngies have significantly improved a current best solver on\r\nrandom 5-SAT benchmarks. Usually our solver needs\r\nmuch less flips than all others, which implies that our\r\nheuristic is the most informative and closest to the in-\r\nsight of most instances, and it has solved the cycling\r\nproblem to a much greater extent.",

The simulation looks at maize cropping opportunities using 100 years of climate data, looking at the potential yields through changes in management such as timing of planting with respect to occurrence of rainfall. it also envisage at looking at the impact of climate change and variability to see how we can better improve crop management to improve yield reliability.\r\n\r\nAPSIM is windows-based and attempts to run it at Linux HPC relies on the use of Mono to emulate the windows registry.

In this paper we\r\nhave developed a GSAT-based solver based on the no-\r\ntions of penult age and k-distance variable that prevent\r\ncycles in a novel locking and unlocking mechanism, to-\r\ngether with a hash heuristic as an auxiliary. On random\r\n3-SAT benchmarks our solver outstrips all others on\r\nmost instances, and surpasses other GSAT-based solvers\r\nby orders of magnitude on huge instances. Moreover, on\r\ncrafted benchmarks we have improved the solving ca-\r\npabilities of local search solvers, and solved much more\r\ninstances than others in some domains. So far our strate-\r\ngies have significantly improved a current best solver on\r\nrandom 5-SAT benchmarks. Usually our solver needs\r\nmuch less flips than all others, which implies that our\r\nheuristic is the most informative and closest to the in-\r\nsight of most instances, and it has solved the cycling\r\nproblem to a much greater extent.",

Five transect sites will be used: two at Flat Rock, two at Shag Rock and one at Manta Bommie. Detailed maps of Shag Rock and Manta Bommie will be created.

So far our strate-\r\ngies have significantly improved a current best solver on\r\nrandom 5-SAT benchmarks.

In this paper we\r\nhave developed a GSAT-based solver based on the no-\r\ntions of penult age and k-distance variable that prevent\r\ncycles in a novel locking and unlocking mechanism, to-\r\ngether with a hash heuristic as an auxiliary. On random\r\n3-SAT benchmarks our solver outstrips all others on\r\nmost instances, and surpasses other GSAT-based solvers\r\nby orders of magnitude on huge instances. Moreover, on\r\ncrafted benchmarks we have improved the solving ca-\r\npabilities of local search solvers, and solved much more\r\ninstances than others in some domains. So far our strate-\r\ngies have significantly improved a current best solver on\r\nrandom 5-SAT benchmarks. Usually our solver needs\r\nmuch less flips than all others, which implies that our\r\nheuristic is the most informative and closest to the in-\r\nsight of most instances, and it has solved the cycling\r\nproblem to a much greater extent.",
