        "use_case": "In this project, an algorithm has been developed to infer a persons road trajectory using POI information sent to a LBS such as Google Maps.\r\n\r\nWe have a number of use cases from the Microsoft Geolife dataset to test the algorithm on.\r\n\r\nThe system that runs the algorithm is distributed so the more machines that run the software, the faster the results will be produced and refinements can be made.\r\n\r\nA working instance and snapshot has been created which runs the system, all that is required now is the ability to load more instances.\r\n\r\nProject Summary\r\n\r\nMobile smart phones have become ubiquitous. The market success of these devices combined with advancements in mobile network infrastructure has created a strong market for third party apps and location based service (LBS) providers. While the apps and service providers are of great convenience to its users, there are concerns of the privacy implications associated.\r\n\r\nSmart phones capture a lot of information about a user. We hypothesis that data internal to these devices sent via a network can be combined with rich external data to recreate a very accurate profile about an individual. \r\n\r\nWhile it's often speculated that personal information can be inferred from sensitive data, literature to highlight tools and techniques utilized to invade user privacy is scarce.\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nMobile privacy has recently become a well-researched topic in pervasive computing.\r\n\r\nHowever, little work has been attempted on inferring personal information about a user such as communications meta-data, trajectories of individuals accessing location-based services, social media services used and if mobile sensors can be used to ID a person. We present a collection of algorithms and techniques that is able to infer information about an individual based on data stored on a mobile device. \r\n\r\nAn individual\u2019s trajectory to a high degree of precision was established given that they send continuous queries requesting the closest point of interest (e.g., restaurant) from a location service provider. The algorithm to infer the user\u2019s trajectory is based on the query result locations instead of the actual user locations.\r\n\r\nLegislation may not permit the location service provider to exchange user location data, but may permit the exchange of the query results with third parties. We reveal a user\u2019s trajectory via an indirect approach showing that user privacy is not preserved with the storage and exchange of query results. Experimental evaluation indicates in some cases that a user\u2019s trajectory can be determined to a high accuracy given a small set of points in real scenarios. \r\n\r\nThe current platforms dominating the mobile market including iOS and Android allow for easy collection of user information via the public APIs they provide. We demonstrate how data can be sent to a remote server without the user being aware and highlight mobile applications are requesting excessive use of permissions in the Google Play store relative to the advertised functionality they provide.\r\n\r\nKeywords: location, privacy, inference attack, trajectory, Voronoi diagram, points of interest, mobile smart phones\r\n\r\n",
