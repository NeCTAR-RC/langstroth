      "message": "this will need to be rewritten to support the user registrations metric in graphite.  I have copied a version of it from the production server so that there will be reasonably up to date data.\n\nI would look at the langstroth.views.total_instance_count for an example of how to do this.  The metric is called users.total you should be able to access and use it from the graphite interface.",

Already buried in the Graphite web interface code perhaps?\n\nIf not I would like to create my own.\n\nI\u0027ll be aiming to make the new code have the same interface as the existing UserRegistration class.",

      "message": "there is no generic client for handling graphite connections.  I have just been using the requests library.  There is a bit of duplication, but most of the code is just organising a data structure to pass to urlencode.  Just looking at the old langstroth code.  \n\nAs for the old langstroth code we can remove the builtin graphing now that we are using NVD3 so i\u0027ll do that now.  It will make it clearer what is actually required to query graphite.",

      "message": "the thing is that when you rewrite to use graphite, it will reduce the code here significantly.  So this review will shrink by about ~300 lines.  It will also then no longer need that extra database table/test etc.  This reduction is enough that i think it\u0027s better to do in this commit.  Also any time spend reviewing these 300 lines is wasted, because we know they will be deleted very soon.",
