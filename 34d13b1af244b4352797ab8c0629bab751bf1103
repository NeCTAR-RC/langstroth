Nothing was loaded into the database. \n\nI was waiting for you to come back so I could ask why doesn\u0027t this thing work as expected.\n\nIts been a couple of weeks since I looked at this so hopefully the story is accurate.",

Presumably Django already has tests for that. \n\nWhat would you like to see asserted?",
